# CSS-Shapes.github.io
For this web-page I have taken inspiration from the twitter thread of <a href="https://twitter.com/Prathkum?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" class="twitter-follow-button" data-show-count="false">Follow @Prathkum</a>.

## Why did I build this project?
I have seen the Pratham's thread on Basic CSS Shapes. I thought a web page dedicated to the shapes along with it's CSS and HTML code would be helpful for many bigginers like me. So, I have created this web-page solely concerned about basic shapes along with it's HTML and CSS code. 

## Language Used
HTML </br>
CSS

## Challanges I faced and features I want to add.
I have created this website responsive so, anyone from any device can access it. I wish to add more basic CSS Shapes and their codes to this webpage.

## How to use this Project.
Just click on the url and learn some basic CSS shapes to start your CSS art journey.

## For your suggestions.
I am currently new to open-source. So, any inputs for effective README.md, or any suggestions for the projects as well are appreciated.<br>
